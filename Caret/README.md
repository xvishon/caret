# Caret
Caret is an Obsidian plugin that brings the power of LLMs into your Obsidian Vault. Caret follows all the main Obsidian philosophies. It's local-first, privacy preserving and stores all generated data as local files.


# Features:
- AI Canvas: Use LLMs in the Obsidian Canvas for non-linear chat and more.
- Chat: Chat directly in Obsidian. Reference other files in your vault. All chat logs are stored as vault files.
- Use Any LLMs: Use Caret with local or remote LLMs. Caret has built in support for Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, OpenRouter and you can add any additional models yourself.

## Design Principles
These are the principles that guide the design and development of Caret. If a potential feature doesn't follow these then it probably won't be included in Caret.
- Keep to local-first
- No external services outside of LLM providers. No external APIs, DBs, RAG providers etc. All Caret functionality should come from just Caret.
- All Caret data is should be stored as markdown files within the users vault. Anything that Caret creates or consumes should be savable as a local file.
  


## Contributing
PRs welcome! More guidelines to come on this. But essentially if it's good, readable code that fits the Caret design principles then I'll try my best to incorporate it.

Big emphasis on "follows Caret's design principles". Please don't start working on something that violates a design principle without running it past me first. I don't want you to possibly waste time if it's a feature that I won't be able to incorporate.

## Caret Bounties
Caret had about $2,000 in sales before I decided to opensource it. I'm not keeping any of that money, and instead it will be distributed as bounties for people contributing to Caret. The list of bounties and the contributors who completed them will be listed here.

To participate in bounties DM me about which bounty you want to complete. I'll send payouts via Venmo, Zelle, or some other method TBD. You should complete a bounty within about a week of taking it on. I will try to have it so only one person is working on a given bounty at a time.

## Supporting Caret
Caret is not looking for financial support. The best way you can support Caret is by:
- Making a video of you using Caret, posting it on X and tagging me in it
- Contributing code


But if you do want to support financially, would you pay for a bounty? That could be a fun idea. DM if you would contribute $50-200 to have a feature created.
